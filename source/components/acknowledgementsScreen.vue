                Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License,
                Version 1.1.<br />This license is copied below, and is also
                available with a FAQ at:<br />http://scripts.sil.org/OFL<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------<br />SIL
                OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007<br />-----------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />PREAMBLE<br />The
                goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate
                worldwide<br />development of collaborative font projects, to
                support the font creation<br />efforts of academic and
                linguistic communities, and to provide a free and<br />open
                framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in
                partnership<br />with others.<br /><br />The OFL allows the
                licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and<br />redistributed
                freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The<br />fonts,
                including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,<br />redistributed
                and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved<br />names
                are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,<br />however,
                cannot be released under any other type of license. The<br />requirement
                for fonts to remain under this license does not apply<br />to
                any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.<br /><br />DEFINITIONS<br />&quot;Font
                Software&quot; refers to the set of files released by the
                Copyright<br />Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked
                as such. This may<br />include source files, build scripts and
                documentation.<br /><br />&quot;Reserved Font Name&quot; refers
                to any names specified as such after the<br />copyright
                statement(s).<br /><br />&quot;Original Version&quot; refers to
                the collection of Font Software components as<br />distributed
                by the Copyright Holder(s).<br /><br />&quot;Modified
                Version&quot; refers to any derivative made by adding to,
                deleting,<br />or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of
                the components of the<br />Original Version, by changing formats
                or by porting the Font Software to a<br />new environment.<br /><br />&quot;Author&quot;
                refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical<br />writer
                or other person who contributed to the Font Software.<br /><br />PERMISSION
                AND CONDITIONS<br />Permission is hereby granted, free of
                charge, to any person obtaining<br />a copy of the Font
                Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,<br />redistribute,
                and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font<br />Software,
                subject to the following conditions:<br /><br />1) Neither the
                Font Software nor any of its individual components,<br />in
                Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.<br /><br />2)
                Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be
                bundled,<br />redistributed and/or sold with any software,
                provided that each copy<br />contains the above copyright notice
                and this license. These can be<br />included either as
                stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or<br />in the
                appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or<br />binary
                files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the
                user.<br /><br />3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may
                use the Reserved Font<br />Name(s) unless explicit written
                permission is granted by the corresponding<br />Copyright
                Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name
                as<br />presented to the users.<br /><br />4) The name(s) of the
                Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font<br />Software
                shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any<br />Modified
                Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the<br />Copyright
                Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written<br />permission.<br /><br />5)
                The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in
                whole,<br />must be distributed entirely under this license, and
                must not be<br />distributed under any other license. The
                requirement for fonts to<br />remain under this license does not
                apply to any document created<br />using the Font Software.<br /><br />TERMINATION<br />This
                license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions
                are<br />not met.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER<br />THE FONT SOFTWARE
